Scenario:
In this lab, you will explore polynomial regression as an extension of linear regression
using Excel. You'll learn how polynomial regression can model complex relationships
and compare it with simple linear regression.
Polynomial regression Equation:
Steps to Follow:
1. Data Setup: Use the same dataset you used before in lab (Hours Studied and Scores).
 - Add a new column called "Hours Squared" by squaring the "Hours Studied" values in
Excel.
2. Set Up Polynomial Regression:
 - Use Excelâ€™s LINEST function to create a polynomial regression equation:
 - Calculate the coefficients (a0, a1, and a2) for the polynomial regression.
3. Calculate Predicted Scores:
 - Create a new column called "Predicted Scores (Polynomial)" using the regression
equation and coefficients.
4. Visualize Polynomial Regression:
 - Create a scatter plot using your data (Hours Studied and Scores) and add the
polynomial regression line to the plot.
 - Compare this new polynomial line with the previous linear regression line.
5. Calculate Errors (Residuals):
 - Create a new column called "Residuals (Polynomial)" to find the difference between
the actual scores and the predicted scores.
