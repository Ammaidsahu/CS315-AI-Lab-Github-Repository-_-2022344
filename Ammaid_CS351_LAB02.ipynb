        "\n",
        "**Objective: **\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of the game is to rescue a person (marked as 'R') trapped in a grid filled with obstacles. The player (marked as 'P') must navigate the grid using the shortest path, avoiding obstacles, and reach the rescue person.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Grid-Based Game:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The game takes place on a grid (NxN), where the size of the grid and number of obstacles are determined by the user.\n",
        "The player starts at the top-left corner of the grid (0,0), and the rescue person is placed randomly somewhere on the grid.\n",
        "Obstacles (marked as 'X') are placed randomly and block the player’s path, making navigation more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Player and Rescue Person:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Player (P): The user starts at the top-left of the grid.\n",
        "Rescue Person (R): The person trapped at a random location on the grid who needs to be rescued.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pathfinding Algorithm:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A Algorithm*: The game uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the player’s starting position to the rescue person, taking into account obstacles.\n",
        "Heuristic (Euclidean Distance): The A* algorithm uses Euclidean distance to estimate how close the current position is to the goal (rescue person).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Obstacles:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Random obstacles ('X') are placed in the grid, making certain routes impassable. The player must navigate around these obstacles to reach the goal.\n",
        "Game Concept\n",
        "\n",
        "**Modular Design:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The game is broken into modular functions, making it easy to modify, test, and understand.\n",
        "Each function handles a specific task like creating the grid, adding obstacles, checking valid moves, or executing the A* algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Player Movements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The player can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Diagonal movement is not allowed.\n",
        "The path is dynamically calculated using the A* algorithm and displayed step by step.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Grid Visualization:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The grid is printed with lines separating the cells for better clarity.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Input Parameters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The game requires the user to input the size of the grid (e.g., 6 for a 6x6 grid) and the number of obstacles to be placed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Valid Moves:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The game ensures that only valid moves are allowed (i.e., no movement outside the grid or into obstacles).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial grid is printed with the player’s starting position, obstacles, and the rescue person’s position.\n",
        "Once the path is calculated, the grid is printed again with the path clearly marked from the player to the rescue person.\n",
